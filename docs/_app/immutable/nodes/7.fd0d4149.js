    This video showcases an object-tracking algorithm developed for an exhibit prototype of the scicommhack at CERN (13-15 Nov. 2020). The exhibit aims at describing gravity fringes with the membrane analogy, where marbles rolling on an elastic membrane are the analogy for celestial bodies moving in the outer space.
