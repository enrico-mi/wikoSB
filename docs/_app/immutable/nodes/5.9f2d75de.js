    This project was born as a means for me to learn about the use of colours in film. For each film two images are produced, one in the RGB colour space and another one in gray scale. Each pixel of each image displays the average colour of the pixel during the whole film. The gray scale image is a simple conversion of the RGB one, the aim being to look at brighter and darker areas. For films originally in black and white, only the gray scale version is produced.
